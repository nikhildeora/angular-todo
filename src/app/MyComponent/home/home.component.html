        power and flexibility of this robust framework. Key Angular elements

      </p>

        <li>
          <span> Directives:</span> We utilize Angular directives to enhance the
          user interface, providing dynamic interactions and intuitive user
          experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span> Decorators:</span> Angular decorators are used to enrich the
          functionality of our components, ensuring a clean and maintainable
          codebase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span> Custom Pipes:</span> We've implemented custom pipes to enhance
          the presentation of your todo items, making them more informative and
          visually appealing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span> Form Module:</span> With the Angular Form Module, you can
          effortlessly add new todos. Our app enforces mandatory fields,
          ensuring that each todo is complete and meaningful.

        <li>
          <span> Routing:</span> Angular routing enables seamless navigation
          between different sections of the app, making it easy to manage your
          todos and explore their details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Dynamic Routing:</span> We've implemented dynamic routing,
          allowing you to access in-depth information about each todo item with
          a simple click.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Task Management at Its Best:</h2>

      <p>
        Our todo app provides an efficient and organized way to manage your
        tasks. It automatically sorts todos based on their deadline dates,
        ensuring that the most urgent tasks appear at the top of your list. If a
        task's deadline is within two days or less, it is highlighted in red,
        accompanied by an "urgent" label, making it impossible to miss important
        deadlines.
      </p>

      <h2>Deadlines with Precision:</h2>

      <p>
        Our app lets you set deadlines for your todos, but with a unique twist.
        You can only select the current date or a date in the future, ensuring
        that you stay focused on the tasks at hand and avoid backlogging.
      </p>
